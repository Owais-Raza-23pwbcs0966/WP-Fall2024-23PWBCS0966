            <h1>Workouts:</h1>
            <p>Workout plans are structured regimens designed to help individuals achieve specific fitness goals, such as building strength, improving endurance, or losing weight. These plans typically include a variety of exercises targeting different muscle groups and incorporate various training modalities, such as resistance training, cardiovascular workouts, and flexibility exercises.
            For example, a beginner's workout plan may focus on fundamental movements with lighter weights and higher repetitions,while a more advanced plan might include complex exercises with heavier weights and lower repetitions to buildstrength. Additionally, workout plans can be tailored to accommodate different fitness levels and preferences, oftenspanning a week to a month, with clear instructions on set and rep ranges, rest periods, and progression strategies.</p>
